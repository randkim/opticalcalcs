# opticalcalcs
Python script for performing (for now) basic laser optics calculations.

Once the code gets long enough, the script will be updated into a class such that editing and using will be easier.

LONG TERM AIM: To build a GUI for optical table planning purposes. This will include all distance indications, beam widths at various points in the laser path, and implementations of AOMs, EOMs, and other optical devices.
